# 🚀 Mini Coaching Platform

A full-stack web application for managing coaching services, built with **Ruby on Rails**, **Sidekiq**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and a modern **React + Vite** frontend.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails
- **Frontend:** Nextjs
- **Background Jobs:** Sidekiq
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js & Yarn (for local frontend development)
- Ruby & Rails (if running backend without Docker)

---

## 🐘 Starting the Infrastructure

Start PostgreSQL and Redis services using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d
````

This will spin up:

- `postgres` on port `5432`
    
- `redis` on port `6379`
    

---

## 🖥️ Running Backend (Web + Sidekiq)

Start the Rails web server and Sidekiq with:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Services will be available at:

- **Rails Web App:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    
- **Sidekiq UI:** [http://localhost:3000/sidekiq](http://localhost:3000/sidekiq)
    

---

## 🌐 Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install     # Install dependencies
yarn dev         # Start development server
```

Frontend will be served at:  
➡️ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

## 🧪 Access the App

Once all services are up:

1. Open the frontend in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
    
2. Start exploring and using the Mini Coaching Platform.

## 🔍 Common Issues

### ❌ Error: `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`

This is caused by a known issue with `rollup` and optional dependencies in certain environments. To fix:

```bash
# From the frontend directory
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
yarn install
```

If using Docker for frontend, ensure `node_modules` are not cached across architectures (e.g., ARM vs x86).
